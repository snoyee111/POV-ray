# POV-Ray (Persistence of Vision Raytracer)

## Overview

POV-Ray is a high-quality, open-source ray tracing program that generates images from a scene description. It uses a scripting language to describe the scene, including the objects, lighting, and camera angles. The program renders scenes by simulating the way light interacts with objects to produce photorealistic images.

## Features

- **High-Quality Rendering**: Capable of producing detailed and photorealistic images.
- **Script-Based Scene Description**: Utilizes a scene description language (SDL) for detailed control over the rendering process.
- **Support for Advanced Lighting**: Includes features such as global illumination, radiosity, and complex light effects.
- **Extensive Object Library**: Provides a variety of built-in primitives and support for custom objects.
- **Animations**: Capable of generating animations by creating a series of images and combining them into a video.
- **Extensibility**: Supports plugins and custom extensions for additional functionality.

## Scene Description Language (SDL)

POV-Ray uses its own Scene Description Language (SDL) to define the properties of the scene. Key elements of SDL include:

- **Camera**: Defines the viewpoint and projection of the scene.
  ```cpp
  camera {
    location <0, 2, -5>
    look_at <0, 1, 0>
  }
